      "\"I'll pour this pestilence into his ear. So will I make the net that will enmesh them all.\" It's an adult, Iago, who says that in Othello. And it's grownups that Machiavelli was writing about when he wrote The Prince, his book about manipulating others and seizing power. Notice he titled the book The Prince, not The Little Prince. The Little Prince is actually by somebody else, if you don't know that. But in our American lives, the real era of intrigue and manipulation for most of us is not adulthood. It's adolescence, when our social circle is at its most constricting. Today on our program, a story of betrayal and of someone who holds David Koresh-like powers over others, and who is only in the seventh grade. From WBEZ in Chicago, it's Your Radio Playhouse. I'm Ira Glass. But before we get into the body of our story, we will try, as adults, to manipulate you a little bit at Pledge Central. Let's check in with Pledge Central. Shirley Jahad. Hi, Ira Glass. Hi. We're trying to manipulate the Radio Playhouse listeners, are we? I guess \"manipulate\" has the tune of a negative connotation. Oh, encourage, cajole, lure, maybe? Yeah, and we have all these-- Entice, how about? Entice. Entice is a very-- Seduce? Keep going, baby. You're on a roll. You're on such a roll here. Sure. Well, let's seduce them with this phone number. What is the phone number? We've got to seduce them with this phone number. 312-832-3160. Stop the music dramatically as I say the number. Do it again. 312-832-3160. Maybe a little radio hypnotism. 312-832-3160. Call that number to pledge your support. And I just want to say that we are so anxious to get you to call. We have very special premiums that we're offering during the coming hour that are available at no other time during the drive. We have three and a half or four, depending on how you count them. The very first one-- I'm going to play a little clip of these. These are all audio things. Well, how to begin with this? Explain it, Ira. Well, one of them is we have a cassette of recent work by David Sedaris, much of it heard here on Your Radio Playhouse, some of it heard on Morning Edition. This is all new work, including two radio dramas by the Pinetree Gang, which appear here on Your Radio Playhouse. That's one thing. Another thing is we have this very odd CD called Shut Up, Little Man, which listeners to the show heard. It's a sort of audio verite of these two men recorded through the walls of their apartment as they argued with each other. And finally, we have this thing. Two weeks ago, we had a show where Julia Sweeney told the story of getting cancer. And she told the story of herself getting cancer and of her brother getting cancer. And she told them as stand-up comedy. And she was telling this in a place called Un-Cabaret. It's a club in Los Angeles where essentially, comics come each week, and they tell what are basically comic diary versions of their week. And Un-Cabaret has a CD that's really pretty wonderful with some well-known people and some not-so-well-known people. And here's a sample. They have about 10 minutes of Julia Sweeney's cancer stories. Here's a sample of that. OK, so we're in the doctor's office, and Mike, who's doing really great and is responding really well to the treatment. But he's had so many spinal taps that they can't get into his spinal column anymore. So the doctor comes in. My dad's reading about the plague in India, because that's a good diversion. And my mom is looking at the doctors and saying, \"Now, he looks single.\" And his doctor comes in. He says, \"Michael, we can't get into your spinal column anymore, so we're thinking about putting a shunt in your head. And my brother goes, \"What?\" He goes, \"A shunt?\" And I go, \"A shunt, like, an artificial opening to the brain.\" And Mike goes, \"Well, where would this shunt be?\" And the doctor goes, \"Well, the best place we've found is to put it in the forehead.\" And Mike goes, \"If you think I am going to get a faucet put into my forehead. I'm already 90 pounds, and I have no hair. I'm not going to walk around for a year with a faucet sticking out of my forehead.\" And my mom goes, \"No, I think it's more like a spigot.\" All right, so that's Julia Sweeney. If you want that and more-- and more diary entries from Janeane Garofalo and people who seem less well known. But there's Julia Sweeney, Janeane Garofalo, Beth Lapides, Bob Goldthwait, Taylor Negron, Dana Gould, other people. Ask for that when you call. 832-3160. Shirley, you're still there, right? 832-3160, yeah. And, Shirley, what is the magic word? We haven't even gotten to the extra-special premium. What is the magic word? Oh, the extra-special $4.95-- for $4.95, you can super size it. You can super size it. That's right. If you make the $60 pledge and just say super size it, for another $4.95, you get-- More \"La Bamba\" than you can handle. Here we go. I think I've got it. This one starts kind of slow. This is a punk \"La Bamba.\" They have a little collection of all sorts of \"La Bambas.\" It's one of the most covered songs in music. We have the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. We have punk versions. We have Neil Diamond. This is kind of a surf version. Again, we want you to pledge. We want to please you. We want you to pledge and then to super size it. 312-832-3160. Come on, go for extra fries and an extra large drink. 312-832-3160. Sorry, Ira. No, that's OK. So the idea is 60 bucks for one of the premia and $64.95 for one of the premia plus-- 90 minutes of \"La Bamba.\" Take it on vacation with you, right? To the Caribbean. It makes a fine, fine summertime present for anyone. That's right. 312-832-3160. Call now to pledge your support for Your  Radio Playhouse. OK, Shirley. I'll check back with you in a bit. Thanks, Ira. So let's get to today's story on this, our radio show. This is a story of enemies. But some of the bitterest enemies are people who used to be close friends. And our story begins with the friendship of these two boys named Bob and Dave. And today's program will be in four acts. Act One, Dave's Love. Act Two, Dave's Hate. Act Three, Dave Today. Act Four, Another Dave. That another Dave is David Sedaris, actually. We have a story by David Sedaris coming up. So, Act One. Our story takes place in a small town somewhere on the East Coast. Dave and I became friends in fourth grade, and we were friends through sixth grade. And I have to describe him physically because that's a huge part of his personality. He was-- and he still is-- an extremely wiry person. Very thin. He looks emaciated. And he also, his skin is like a jaundiced yellow color. He was always very acned. Just very pale, pasty, and he just looked sick. I don't really know how we became friends. We were in class together in grade school. But as things progressed into fifth grade, it became pretty clear that our friendship was the most intense friendship in the class. We would talk on the phone at least once a day and for hours. We would just talk for hours and just make each other laugh so hard. And that was why we always got separated in class was just because we weren't troublemakers, we just made each other laugh a lot. We had very similar senses of humor. The scatological jokes were the primary jokes. And I was just thinking about this today. I remembered this one thing that we used to do, which we did obsessively. It's embarrassing to say it, but we were obsessed with the words \"poop\" and \"pee.\" And we made this little thing where I would say \"poop\" and he would say \"pee,\" and then he would say \"wee,\" and then I would say \"gilly gee.\" And so it'd go kind of like, poop, pee, wee, gilly gee. And we said this over and over and over again. And we used to just take books and just insert the words \"poop\" and \"pee\" everywhere. And \"wee\" was like the one word that was just, for some reason, that was like our rallying call. That was like our motto. We just said it all the time. Just \"wee.\" Wee! We used to do that all the time. Wee! Some of the other stuff that we had in common-- our favorite group was The Village People. And we used to listen to The Village People all the time and just totally obsess about them, having no idea what they were singing about at all. And the Dukes of Hazzard was another one, and Star Wars. Those were very big things. And sports. I basically discovered sexuality through him. And we used to play spin the bottle in his room. And we would take off an article of clothing when it would land on us. And it was the first time we'd ever been naked in front of another person except for our parents. And it was petrifying, but it was also just this whole discovery period of seeing another man naked there. And it became this whole game that we played often. And we would revel in the fact of standing there in front of each other totally naked, assuming these characters like, \"Hi, Mr. Jones. How are you? Nice to meet you.\" Businessmen and everything, just standing there completely buck naked and so terrified that we were ever going to get caught, because his parents were always home. They were always in the house and everything, and we were just so afraid that someone was going to knock on the door. The one time that was the biggest scare was he-- Dave basically could get anybody to do anything that he wanted them to do. And he had a camera and was-- these times when I'd go up to his house were fully documented events. He's very anal retentive. And he loved documenting everything was going on. So he would have a camera and take a lot of pictures. And he wanted me to pull down my pants and take a picture of me with my pants down. And I was refusing to do it. I would not let it be caught on film. And he was just insisting, and he went through this entire-- I mean, he was trying to coax me for so long, telling me all these different things that he was going to do for me and saying, \"Oh, nobody's going to see it.\" And he came up with this whole scheme of how nobody would see the film and everything and just these elaborate, elaborate plans on how nobody would see these pictures. And I just kept refusing and refusing and refusing. And finally, at the end of it, he was like, \"All right, just take down you pants anyway. I won't take a picture. I swear to you. I won't take a picture, I promise.\" And I still didn't believe him. And he was like, \"Look, I promise. I promise. I promise,\" This went on for like an hour, of him trying to coax me to take my pants down. And he promised me, bottom of his heart, that he was not going to take a picture. And so I was like, fine. So I like unbuckled my belt, and I unbuckled my pants. And I pulled down my zipper, and I whipped open my pants. And I had my underwear on. And then I put myself all back together again. And when I had my pants open, he took a picture. And I was like, \"Ah!\" And I was terrified because when you're that age, when you're 11 and 12 years old, you can't go in and get your pictures developed yourself and pay for them and get them. And I thought, somebody is going to get these pictures developed, and somebody is going to see them. So weeks later, I was going up to his house again. And in the car going up to his house-- his mother was driving-- he was like, \"I got the pictures back.\" And I said, \"Oh, my god.\" And he was like, \"You're not going to believe what's on there.\" And I said, \"But what can be? You didn't see anything.\" And he's like, \"I know, but you have to see this because it's there.\" And I was like, \"But it can't be because I didn't take my pants down.\" And he was like, \"I know, but it's there. It's there. You have to see it.\" He pulls out the pictures, and I looked at it. And my penis was hanging out there. And I was like, \"But I didn't do it.\" And he was like, \"You must've.\" And I said, \"But I know I didn't. I know I just opened my pants.\" And he said, \"You must've done it. Maybe it just fell out or something.\" And I said, \"But it can't be.\" And we racked our brains just trying to figure out what had happened, because I knew that I hadn't pulled my underwear down. So that night, we were at a high school football game. And we were looking at the pictures again, just examining them. We were way up in the bleachers in a corner. And we took them out, and we were looking at them. And we were trying to explain what had happened. And finally, we figured out that it was the inside of my belt that looked like my penis. And we're like, \"Oh!\" And so I was completely r\n",

      "- The conversation starts with a description of a black-tie dinner at the Ritz Carlton in Lower Manhattan, where awards were given out for financial securities, including the CDO (Collateralized Debt Obligation) that nearly brought down the global financial system during the sub-prime mortgage crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The speaker, Ira Glass, notes the irony of giving awards for instruments that almost destroyed the world economy, but acknowledges that the industry has had a tough year.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The conversation then shifts to a different gathering, organized by the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, where people facing foreclosure and struggling to keep their homes were in attendance.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ira Glass introduces Adam Davidson, NPR's international business and economics correspondent, and Alex Blumberg, who will explain how the sub-prime crisis worked and introduce some of the people involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Alex Blumberg starts by discussing NINA loans (No Income No Asset loans), which allowed people to borrow money without the bank checking their income or assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "- He shares the story of Clarence Nathan, who took out a $540,000 loan without the bank verifying his income, and is now facing foreclosure.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Clarence acknowledges that he made an imprudent decision, but notes that the bank also made an imprudent loan, and that they are partners in the deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Adam Davidson explains that the global pool of money, estimated to be around $70 trillion, is looking for low-risk investments with a decent return.\n",
      "\n",
      "- He notes that the pool of money has doubled since 2000, driven by the growth of poor countries becoming rich, and that investment managers are desperate to find good investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The conversation touches on Alan Greenspan's decision to keep interest rates low, which made US Treasury bonds less attractive to investors, leading them to look elsewhere for investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Adam Davidson explains that the global pool of money fell in love with residential mortgages, which seemed like a low-risk, high-return investment, and that Wall Street firms like Morgan Stanley were happy to provide them. \n",

      "Summarizing chunk 2/5\n",
      "Here is a summary of the meeting transcript in bullet points:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The global pool of money was seeking higher yields, and Wall Street found a way to provide them by creating mortgage-backed securities, which allowed investors to benefit from mortgages without the hassle and risk of individual mortgages.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Mike Francis, a Wall Street investment banker, would buy thousands of mortgages, package them into a pool, and sell shares of the monthly income to investors, creating a huge demand for mortgage-backed securities.\n",
      "\n",
      "- To satisfy this demand, Mike needed to buy up as many mortgages as possible, which led to the creation of riskier mortgages, such as stated income verified asset loans, stated income stated assets loans, no income verified asset loans, and no income no asset loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Mike Garner, a mortgage banker in Nevada, would buy individual mortgages from brokers, bundle them together, and sell them to Wall Street, where they would be packaged into mortgage-backed securities.\n",
      "\n",
      "- As the demand for mortgage-backed securities grew, the guidelines for approving mortgages became increasingly lax, allowing people who would not have qualified for loans before to take out mortgages.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Housing prices were rising fast, and many in the mortgage industry believed that housing prices would never go down, making it seem like a safe bet to approve more and more loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Mike Garner's bank did not care about the riskiness of the mortgages, as they would only own them for a month or two before selling them to Wall Street, which would then sell them to the global pool of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The pressure to approve more loans led to the creation of even riskier mortgages, such as loans to dead people, and the faith in rising housing prices made it seem like a safe bet.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Mike Garner's company would sell mortgages to Wall Street investment banks, which would then sell them to the global pool of money, creating a huge profit for everyone involved.\n",

      "- Glen Pizzolorusso, an area sales manager at WMC Mortgage, would make $75,000 to $100,000 a month selling mortgages, and would spend his free time partying with B-list celebrities.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Glen didn't worry about whether the loans were good or not, as that was someone else's problem, and the company was making a huge profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Mike Francis, the Wall Street investment banker, knew that the NINA loans (no income no asset loans) were bad loans, but he bought them anyway because everybody else was doing it, and the software analytics didn't seem worried about the risk. \n",

      "\n",
      "- The subprime mortgage crisis was fueled by the creation of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that were given high ratings by credit rating agencies despite being based on risky mortgages.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The data used to assess the risk of these securities was flawed, relying on historical foreclosure rates that were irrelevant to the new types of mortgages being given out.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Investors trusted the credit rating agencies and bought these securities, which were considered as safe as US government bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The creation of CDOs, which pooled together tranches of MBS, further exacerbated the problem by allowing companies to create highly rated securities from lower-rated tranches.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Companies like Dynamic Credit, run by Jim Finkel, created CDOs by pooling together tranches of MBS and selling them to investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The CDO industry faced pressure to loosen standards and create more CDOs, which led to the creation of securities from lower and lower rated tranches.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Some companies, like Dynamic Credit, declined to create CDOs from lower-rated tranches, but others did, and these securities eventually blew up.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The housing market was in a speculative bubble from 2003 to 2006, with housing prices increasing rapidly and people buying houses as investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The bubble burst in late 2006, and mortgage lenders started to notice that people were defaulting on their mortgages even before making their first payment.\n",
      "\n",
      "- As property values declined, it set off a reverse chain reaction, with more people defaulting, more houses coming on the market, and prices going down further.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Mortgage-backed securities desks on Wall Street started to back away from the riskiest mortgages, which had a devastating effect on mortgage companies that relied on selling these loans to Wall Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "- These companies, which were highly leveraged, were unable to sell their loans and defaulted on their own debts, leading to widespread job losses and company failures. \n",

      "\n",
      "- Glen Pizzolorusso, a former mortgage sales manager, shares his experience of making large amounts of money but still struggling to cover his expenses, and eventually having to borrow money from his dad to avoid foreclosure.\n",

      "- Richard, a marine, is fighting to keep his home and is working with a counselor to figure out how to modify his mortgage to make it more affordable.\n",

      "- The counselor, Kerry Campbell, helps Richard go through his finances and determines that he needs a much cheaper mortgage to stay in his house.\n",
      "\n",
      "- However, the problem is that Richard's loan has been bought and sold multiple times, making it difficult to determine who owns the loan and who to negotiate with.\n",

      "- Jim Finkel, an investor, owns a share of 16 million homes through his company, and uses software to track the performance of each loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The software shows that many homeowners are delinquent on their loans, and the investors are struggling to understand the extent of the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The global pool of money has lost trillions of dollars due to the sub-prime mortgage crisis, leading to a credit crisis where investors are now obsessed with safety and avoiding risk.\n",
